## Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW)

Creating a full-fledged Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) and Data Mart for a book store is a complex task that typically involves a significant amount of planning and design. In this text-based format, I can provide you with a simplified example of an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for a Data Warehouse and Data Mart in a book store scenario, along with SQL code and sample data for one fact table and three dimension tables.

Using a star schema instead of a snowflake schema for a data warehouse in a book store context can be a more suitable choice for several reasons:

1. **Simplicity and Ease of Use**: Star schemas are simpler and easier to understand for business users, analysts, and report developers. They involve fewer tables and joins, making it more straightforward to write and maintain SQL queries. This simplicity can lead to increased productivity among users who need to access and analyze data.

2. **Query Performance**: Star schemas generally offer better query performance compared to snowflake schemas. With fewer joins involved, queries can be executed more quickly, which is crucial for analytical and reporting purposes. This faster query performance allows for quicker access to insights and reports.

3. **Agility and Flexibility**: Star schemas are more agile and flexible when it comes to adapting to changing business needs. If you need to add new dimensions or modify existing ones, changes can be made to the schema with minimal impact on other parts of the system. This agility is beneficial in a dynamic business environment.

4. **Tool Compatibility**: Many Business Intelligence (BI) and reporting tools are optimized for star schemas. Using a star schema can lead to better compatibility with these tools, streamlining the reporting and analytics process. It can also reduce the complexity of setting up connections between tools and the data warehouse.

5. **Performance Optimization**: Star schemas allow for easier implementation of performance optimization techniques, such as indexing and materialized views. These optimizations can further enhance query performance and responsiveness.

6. **User Adoption**: Star schemas are generally more intuitive for end-users, resulting in quicker user adoption. When users find it easier to access and work with data, they are more likely to embrace data-driven decision-making practices.

7. **Scalability**: Star schemas are often more scalable as data volumes grow. They can handle large amounts of data without significant degradation in query performance, making them suitable for a growing book store's data needs.

8. **Reduced Complexity**: Snowflake schemas can introduce unnecessary complexity by normalizing data into multiple related tables. While normalization has its benefits in transactional databases, it can add complexity and potentially hinder performance in a data warehousing context.

However, it's important to note that the choice between a star schema and a snowflake schema should ultimately align with the specific business requirements, data modeling standards, and preferences of your organization. In some cases, a snowflake schema may be more appropriate, especially when dealing with highly normalized data or strict data integrity requirements.

Before making a decision, it's essential to carefully analyze your data and consider the reporting and analytical needs of your book store to determine the most suitable schema design for your data warehouse.

### Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD):

Please note that in a real-world scenario, the design and structure of the data warehouse would be more comprehensive and tailored to the specific needs of the business.

Here's a simplified ERD for the Data Warehouse and Data Mart:

1. Fact Table:
   - `SalesFact` (Fact)
     - sales_id (Primary Key)
     - book_id (Foreign Key)
     - customer_id (Foreign Key)
     - date_id (Foreign Key)
     - quantity_sold
     - total_sales_amount

2. Dimension Tables:
   - `BookDim` (Dimension)
     - book_id (Primary Key)
     - book_title
     - author
     - genre
     - publication_year
     - publisher

   - `CustomerDim` (Dimension)
     - customer_id (Primary Key)
     - customer_name
     - email
     - phone
     - address

   - `DateDim` (Dimension)
     - date_id (Primary Key)
     - date
     - day_of_week
     - month
     - quarter
     - year

### SQL Code:

Here's an example of SQL code to create the above tables:

```sql
-- Create Dimension Tables
CREATE TABLE BookDim (
    book_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    book_title VARCHAR(255),
    author VARCHAR(255),
    genre VARCHAR(255),
    publication_year INT,
    publisher VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE TABLE CustomerDim (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_name VARCHAR(255),
    email VARCHAR(255),
    phone VARCHAR(20),
    address VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE TABLE DateDim (
    date_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    date DATE,
    day_of_week VARCHAR(10),
    month VARCHAR(10),
    quarter VARCHAR(10),
    year INT
);

-- Create Fact Table
CREATE TABLE SalesFact (
    sales_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    book_id INT,
    customer_id INT,
    date_id INT,
    quantity_sold INT,
    total_sales_amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    FOREIGN KEY (book_id) REFERENCES BookDim(book_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES CustomerDim(customer_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (date_id) REFERENCES DateDim(date_id)
);
```

### Sample Data:

Here's some sample data for one fact table record and three dimension tables:

**BookDim Table Sample Data:**

| book_id | book_title        | author         | genre     | publication_year | publisher         |
| ------- | ----------------- | -------------- | --------- | ----------------- | ------------------ |
| 1       | The Great Gatsby  | F. Scott Fit.. | Fiction   | 1925            | Scribner           |
| 2       | To Kill a Mock..  | Harper Lee     | Fiction   | 1960            | HarperCollins     |
| 3       | 1984              | George Orwell  | Fiction   | 1949            | Penguin Books     |

**CustomerDim Table Sample Data:**

| customer_id | customer_name    | email                  | phone        | address                   |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ---------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------- |
| 101         | John Doe         | john.doe@example.com   | 123-456-7890 | 123 Main St, Anytown, USA |
| 102         | Jane Smith       | jane.smith@example.com | 987-654-3210 | 456 Elm St, Othertown, USA |
| 103         | Bob Johnson      | bob.j@example.com      | 555-123-4567 | 789 Oak St, Anothercity, USA |

**DateDim Table Sample Data:**

| date_id | date       | day_of_week | month    | quarter | year |
| ------- | ---------- | ----------- | -------- | ------- | ---- |
| 1       | 2023-09-01 | Thursday    | September| Q3      | 2023 |
| 2       | 2023-09-02 | Friday      | September| Q3      | 2023 |
| 3       | 2023-09-03 | Saturday    | September| Q3      | 2023 |

**SalesFact Table Sample Data:**

| sales_id | book_id | customer_id | date_id | quantity_sold | total_sales_amount |
| -------- | ------- | ----------- | ------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| 1        | 1       | 101         | 1       | 2             | 24.99               |

Please note that in a real-world scenario, these tables would be populated with a significant amount of data, and you would need to design a comprehensive ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process to keep the data warehouse up to date. Additionally, you would create more dimensions and facts to support various analytical queries and reporting needs.

Sure, here's sample SQL INSERT statements to populate the previously defined tables with data:

**BookDim Table Sample Data:**

```sql
-- Insert sample data into BookDim table
INSERT INTO BookDim (book_id, book_title, author, genre, publication_year, publisher)
VALUES
    (1, 'The Great Gatsby', 'F. Scott Fitzgerald', 'Fiction', 1925, 'Scribner'),
    (2, 'To Kill a Mockingbird', 'Harper Lee', 'Fiction', 1960, 'HarperCollins'),
    (3, '1984', 'George Orwell', 'Fiction', 1949, 'Penguin Books');
```

**CustomerDim Table Sample Data:**

```sql
-- Insert sample data into CustomerDim table
INSERT INTO CustomerDim (customer_id, customer_name, email, phone, address)
VALUES
    (101, 'John Doe', 'john.doe@example.com', '123-456-7890', '123 Main St, Anytown, USA'),
    (102, 'Jane Smith', 'jane.smith@example.com', '987-654-3210', '456 Elm St, Othertown, USA'),
    (103, 'Bob Johnson', 'bob.j@example.com', '555-123-4567', '789 Oak St, Anothercity, USA');
```

**DateDim Table Sample Data:**

```sql
-- Insert sample data into DateDim table
INSERT INTO DateDim (date_id, date, day_of_week, month, quarter, year)
VALUES
    (1, '2023-09-01', 'Thursday', 'September', 'Q3', 2023),
    (2, '2023-09-02', 'Friday', 'September', 'Q3', 2023),
    (3, '2023-09-03', 'Saturday', 'September', 'Q3', 2023);
```

**SalesFact Table Sample Data:**

```sql
-- Insert sample data into SalesFact table
INSERT INTO SalesFact (sales_id, book_id, customer_id, date_id, quantity_sold, total_sales_amount)
VALUES
    (1, 1, 101, 1, 2, 24.99),
    (2, 2, 102, 2, 3, 34.99),
    (3, 3, 103, 3, 1, 14.99),
    (4, 1, 102, 1, 2, 24.99),
    (5, 2, 101, 2, 4, 49.99),
    (6, 3, 103, 3, 3, 34.99),
    (7, 1, 103, 1, 2, 24.99),
    (8, 2, 102, 2, 3, 34.99),
    (9, 3, 101, 3, 1, 14.99),
    (10, 1, 102, 1, 2, 24.99),
    (11, 2, 101, 2, 4, 49.99),
    (12, 3, 102, 3, 3, 34.99),
    (13, 1, 103, 1, 2, 24.99),
    (14, 2, 102, 2, 3, 34.99),
    (15, 3, 101, 3, 1, 14.99),
    (16, 1, 102, 1, 2, 24.99),
    (17, 2, 103, 2, 4, 49.99),
    (18, 3, 102, 3, 3, 34.99),
    (19, 1, 101, 1, 2, 24.99),
    (20, 2, 101, 2, 3, 34.99);

-- Insert additional data into dimension tables if needed
-- For example, add more books, customers, and dates to the dimension tables

```

These INSERT statements will populate the tables with the sample data provided earlier. You can continue to add more records to these tables as needed for your testing or development purposes.

Certainly! Here are two sample Data Marts that can be created from the Data Warehouse described above, along with their respective business cases:

**Data Mart 1: Sales Analysis Data Mart**

*Business Case:*
This Data Mart is designed to provide in-depth sales analysis for the book store. It enables the business to gain insights into their sales performance, track trends, and make informed decisions.

These Data Marts serve as specialized subsets of the Data Warehouse, tailored to specific business needs. They allow stakeholders to access relevant data quickly and make data-driven decisions to improve sales, customer relationships, and overall business performance.

Creating SQL code for Data Marts typically involves designing specific queries and views based on the requirements of the Data Mart. Below, I'll provide sample SQL code for creating views within the Data Mart context for the two Data Marts described earlier. Please note that these are simplified examples, and in practice, you may need more complex SQL queries and data transformation depending on your actual business requirements.

**Data Mart 1: Sales Analysis Data Mart**

*Views:*

```sql
-- Create a view to analyze monthly sales trends
CREATE VIEW MonthlySalesTrends AS
SELECT
    D.year,
    D.month,
    SUM(S.quantity_sold) AS total_quantity_sold,
    SUM(S.total_sales_amount) AS total_sales_amount
FROM
    SalesFact S
JOIN
    DateDim D ON S.date_id = D.date_id
GROUP BY
    D.year, D.month
ORDER BY
    D.year, D.month;

-- Create a view to analyze top selling books
CREATE VIEW TopSellingBooks AS
SELECT
    B.book_title,
    SUM(S.quantity_sold) AS total_quantity_sold,
    SUM(S.total_sales_amount) AS total_sales_amount
FROM
    SalesFact S
JOIN
    BookDim B ON S.book_id = B.book_id
GROUP BY
    B.book_title
ORDER BY
    total_quantity_sold DESC;

-- Create other views for additional metrics and reports as needed
```

**Data Mart 2: Customer Insights Data Mart**

*Views:*

```sql
-- Create a view to calculate Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
CREATE VIEW CustomerLifetimeValue AS
SELECT
    C.customer_id,
    C.customer_name,
    SUM(S.total_sales_amount) AS total_sales_amount
FROM
    SalesFact S
JOIN
    CustomerDim C ON S.customer_id = C.customer_id
GROUP BY
    C.customer_id, C.customer_name
ORDER BY
    total_sales_amount DESC;

-- Create a view to analyze purchase patterns
CREATE VIEW PurchasePatterns AS
SELECT
    C.customer_id,
    C.customer_name,
    COUNT(S.sales_id) AS total_purchases,
    MAX(D.date) AS last_purchase_date
FROM
    SalesFact S
JOIN
    CustomerDim C ON S.customer_id = C.customer_id
JOIN
    DateDim D ON S.date_id = D.date_id
GROUP BY
    C.customer_id, C.customer_name
ORDER BY
    total_purchases DESC;

-- Create other views for customer segmentation, product affinity, churn analysis, etc., as needed
```

These SQL views are just starting points for your Data Marts. Depending on your specific business requirements, you may need to create additional views or customize the existing ones to provide the necessary data for your reports and analyses. Additionally, you can use these views as data sources for your BI tools or reporting applications to visualize and interact with the data.


### Create or Copy Table: DM_monthlysalestrends
This SQL operation focuses on the creation or duplication of a table named `DM_monthlysalestrends`. The objective is to either establish a new table with this name or replicate the data structure and content of an existing table known as `monthlysalestrends`. This process is designed to maintain data consistency and structure while offering flexibility in database management tasks.

**SQL Code:**

```sql
-- Create or Copy Table: DM_monthlysalestrends
-- Description: Create a new table or copy data into an existing table named DM_monthlysalestrends from the public.monthlysalestrends table.
-- This SQL statement ensures that the new table matches the structure and data of the source table.
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.DM_monthlysalestrends AS
SELECT * FROM public.monthlysalestrends;
```

**Usage Guidelines:**

- **Table Creation:** If the table `DM_monthlysalestrends` does not already exist, this SQL code will create it. It precisely mirrors the structure and content of the source table `public.monthlysalestrends`.

- **Table Duplication:** If the table `DM_monthlysalestrends` already exists, this SQL code will not recreate it. Instead, it will populate the existing table with data from `public.monthlysalestrends`. This is useful for maintaining backups or derived tables for analytical purposes.

- **Schema and Database:** The code assumes that both the source table `public.monthlysalestrends` and the destination table `DM_monthlysalestrends` reside in the same database and schema ("public"). Ensure that the appropriate database context is set before executing the code.

- **Data Consistency:** This operation preserves data integrity by copying all rows and columns from the source table. Any changes in the source table will be reflected in the destination table upon execution.

- **Error Handling:** The use of `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` ensures that the code will not produce errors if the destination table already exists.

**Note:** Be cautious when using this code in production environments, as it can potentially overwrite or duplicate data. Always verify the database context and table names before executing the SQL statement.
